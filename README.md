# Pattern Generator
## EE103 - Introduction to Programming | Project
The goal of this project is to generate different patterns using base patterns. The final patterns generated can be displayed either as an image or from .txt file using printf library function.

### Level 1
Initially assume that you have a 20x20 coordinate system having 400 points whose coordinates are integers in the range from 0 to 20, as shown below. Allocate a memory space for a 20x20 integer array to represent these points and initialize it to all zeros.

Write the following base pattern functions to record them to this array.
- Ellipse
- Rectangle
- Isosceles Triangle
- Ring
- Rectangular Frame
- Plus Sign
- X
- T
- H
